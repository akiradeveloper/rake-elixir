# Rake-Elixir

This is an implementation of Rake rewritten in Elixir.

## Elixir

Elixir is a Ruby-like new language running on Erlang VM
which puts more focuses on meta-programming to build a DSL.
This project is an experiment to examine the extensibility.

## Features

This project will possibly support these rudimentary features.
At this point, I am not sure I could do this in Elixir.

To list the tasks registered

```
$ potion -T
task1 - do task 1
task2 - do task 2
clean - Let's clean up
```

To run a task

```
$ potion task1
```
